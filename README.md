Protocol Buffers 3 for Unity 5
==============================

Overview
--------

Forked from [https://github.com/google/protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf). The oringal C# project uses some new APIs of .NET 4 which do not supported by Unity/Mono. I've made some changes to the code to make it compatiable with Unity/Mono.

How to compile
--------------
Open the project file (./csharp/src/Google.Protobuf/Google.Protobuf.Unity.csproj) in MonoDevelope (or Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio) an build.

How to use
----------
Copy Google.Protobuf.Unity.dll to the Assets folder of Unity project and enjoy it!
